By correcting the typo and enabling error logging, the website was resurrected from its digital slumber, ready to face whatever challenges the digital frontier had in store.

Corrective and Preventive Measures:

Enable Error Logging: Like a vigilant sentinel, ensure that error logging is always enabled to catch mischievous typos and lurking gremlins before they wreak havoc.
Local Testing: Before unleashing our creations upon the world, let us first subject them to the rigors of local testing, sparing us from the embarrassment of public failures.
